# Developer Guide

PUBLISHED 11 APR 2013

## Before you begin

This is a getting started page for Tizen developers.
We recommend reading the [Development Workflow](https://source.tizen.org/documentation/work-flow) page first.

## Getting access

Developers can register for an account at: [https://www.tizen.org/user/register](https://www.tizen.org/user/register)

## Development work flow

Tizen developers use the git and [gbs command-line tools](https://source.tizen.org/documentation/reference/git-build-system) for most of their work.
Tizen source code is managed by [Gerrit](https://source.tizen.org/documentation/reference/gerrit-usage), a code review system for Git-based projects. Source code cloning, development, and review are under ACL (Access Control Lists). Make sure you get rights to access them.
